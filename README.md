## Customizing Fill Opacity
To adjust the transparency of the elevation area fill, edit the following line in `GPX3DPlotter.jsx`:

```js
const fillMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ vertexColors: true, transparent: true, opacity: 0.15 });
```

You can change the `opacity` value (between 0 and 1) to control how visible or soft the filled area appears.
